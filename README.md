# üìùIntroduction

Still, damage to fire accidents continues to occur. According to the U.S. Fire Administration, the average number of fire accidents from 2010 to 2019 was 1,300,000.
In detail, in 2019, 40.4% were externally occurring fires, 29.9% in residential spaces, 15.1% in vehicles, 9.4% in non-residential spaces, and 5.2% in other areas, and 39.3% of fires in buildings can be confirmed.
In order to prevent accidents involving indoor fires, this study was conducted by developing an app that informs the optimal route for indoor fire evacuation by using beacons.

<br>

> ### Novelty

1. Use beacons to determine the exact location of the user in the building.

2. Develop user-friendly application such as informing users of the beacon installation location by providing users with the ability to upload and modify building blueprints.

3. Identify the density of people in the building and calculate the weight value to inform the optimal path.

<br>

> ### IEEE Paper

We are currently working on a fix.

![system](https://github.com/Mak-nae-on-Top/Mak-nae-on-Top/blob/main/Image/system.png?raw=true)

    1. When the manager uploads a blueprint for each floor, the application converts it to a map.
    2. When the manager enters the name of each room, the user‚Äôs location data is obtained using bluetooth beacon.
    3. In peacetime, the application shows an optimized route to the destination that the user wants.
    4. In the event of a fire, a fire alarm that is linked to the server notifies the server of the occurrence of the fire, and the server notifies the user of the fire through the application.
    5. The application displays the fastest escape route from the current user location on the map considering the current population cluster.

# üçöAlgorithm

> ### 1. A\* algorithm

<br>

![algorithm](https://github.com/Mak-nae-on-Top/Mak-nae-on-Top/raw/main/Image/route.png)

    The node that minimizes the cost from the start node to the current node g(n) is selected as the next search node.

    The function h(n) that finds the expected cost from the current node to the target node is called the heuristic function, and the Manhattan equation is used here.

<br>
<br>

> ### 2. Trilaterration

<br>

![trilaterration](https://github.com/Mak-nae-on-Top/Mak-nae-on-Top/raw/main/Image/trilateration.png)

<br>

Using Tx Power (transmission strength) and RSSI (reception strength), the straight-line distance between a beacon and a smart device can be calculated. After installing at least 3 beacons, measure the indoor location by trilaterration.

    1. Nodes A, B, and C are the locations where the beacon is installed, and D is the location (x,y) of the smart device.
    2. The calculated distances from nodes A, B, and C to the smart devices are e, f, and g D, respectively, which is determined using the path loss model.

<br>
<br>

# üå≥Server

> ### 1. Setup

[Server code git link](https://github.com/Mak-nae-on-Top/Server)

    - Server: Spring boot 2.6.3
    - Database: MariaDB
    - Executable file location: Server/build/libs/demo.0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

> ### 2. Diagram

![server](https://github.com/Mak-nae-on-Top/Mak-nae-on-Top/raw/main/Image/server.png)

<br>

    The server uses the spring boot framework and Database uses MariaDB and are distributed through AWS.
    The server receives the id of the beacon from the app and the distance between the user and the beacon through the http protocol. With this data, the server estimates the user's location using trilateration.
    The database is largely composed of five tables: a beacon table storing ID and location information, a building table storing the name and manager of the building, a room table storing the name and location of the room, a population table storing users' locations, and a user table storing user information.

<br>
<br>

# üìπIoT

![iot](https://github.com/Mak-nae-on-Top/Mak-nae-on-Top/raw/main/Image/IoT.jpg)

    1. Install flame sensor and beacon indoors.
    2. When a fire is detected, the Nodemcu communicates with the server through the connected wifi.
       Otherwise, the detection is repeated until the screen is detected.
    3. The device detects the Beacon's signals through a Bluetooth connection.
    4. The app can monitor the user's location.
    5. Manage users' data and IoT devices on the server.
