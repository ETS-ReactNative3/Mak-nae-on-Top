# Introduction

> Development of an optimization route guide application for indoor fire evacuation using beacons

Still, damage to fire accidents continues to occur. According to the U.S. Fire Administration, the average number of fire accidents from 2010 to 2019 was 1,300,000.
In detail, in 2019, 40.4% were externally occurring fires, 29.9% in residential spaces, 15.1% in vehicles, 9.4% in non-residential spaces, and 5.2% in other areas, and 39.3% of fires in buildings can be confirmed.
In order to prevent accidents involving indoor fires, this study was conducted by developing an app that informs the optimal route for indoor fire evacuation by using beacons.
