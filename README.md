# üìùIntroduction

Still, damage to fire accidents continues to occur. According to the U.S. Fire Administration, the average number of fire accidents from 2010 to 2019 was 1,300,000.
In detail, in 2019, 40.4% were externally occurring fires, 29.9% in residential spaces, 15.1% in vehicles, 9.4% in non-residential spaces, and 5.2% in other areas, and 39.3% of fires in buildings can be confirmed.
In order to prevent accidents involving indoor fires, this study was conducted by developing an app that informs the optimal route for indoor fire evacuation by using beacons.

<br>

> ### Novelty

    1. Use beacons to determine the exact location of the user in the building.

    2. Develop user-friendly application such as informing users of the beacon installation location by providing users with the ability to upload and modify building blueprints.

    3. Identify the density of people in the building and calculate the weight value to inform the optimal path.

<br>

> ### IEEE Paper

We are currently working on a fix.

    1. When the manager uploads a blueprint for each floor, the application converts it to a map.
    2. When the manager enters the name of each room, the user‚Äôs location data is obtained using bluetooth beacon.
    3. In peacetime, the application shows an optimized route to the destination that the user wants.
    4. In the event of a fire, a fire alarm that is linked to the server notifies the server of the occurrence of the fire, and the server notifies the user of the fire through the application.
    5. The application displays the fastest escape route from the current user location on the map considering the current population cluster.

<br>

<p align="center"><img src="./Image/trilateration.png" style="width:600px"></p>

<br>

Using Tx Power (transmission strength) and RSSI (reception strength), the straight-line distance between a beacon and a smart device can be calculated. After installing at least 3 beacons, measure the indoor location by trilaterration.

    1. Nodes A, B, and C are the locations where the beacon is installed, and D is the location (x,y) of the smart device.
    2. The calculated distances from nodes A, B, and C to the smart devices are e, f, and g D, respectively, which is determined using the path loss model.
